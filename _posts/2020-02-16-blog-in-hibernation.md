There's not much activity on the Extempore blog. But that doesn't mean that
Extempore's dead---not by a long shot. It just means that the WIP/dev blog stuff
is being posted elsewhere.

If you want to follow what the Extempore team are up to, then follow [Andy on
twitter](https://twitter.com/digego) or Ben on
[twitter](https://twitter.com/benswift) or [his blog](https://benswift.me).
