            <p>
              Extempore is a programming language and runtime environment
              designed to support <strong>cyberphysical programming</strong>,
              where a human programmer operates as an active agent in a
              real-time distributed network of environmentally aware systems.
              The cyberphysical programmer interacts with the distributed
              real-time system procedurally by modifying code on-the-fly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Extempore provides a completely hotswappable runtime environment
              with a strong temporal semantics, a flexible concurrency
              architecture, builtin support for distributed heterogenous
              operation (both OS and Architecture), and aims to provide flexible
              compiler-as-a-service functionality. Extempore makes extensive use
              of the LLVM project to provide back-end code generation.

            <p>
              <strong>xtlang</strong> is a new systems programming language
              designed to support the programming of real-time systems <emph>in
              real-time</emph>. xtlang is designed to mix the high-level
              expressiveness of Lisp with the low-level expressiveness of C.
            </p>

            <p>
              xtlang uses an s-expression syntax similar to Scheme, and borrows
              many Lisp-like semantics including first class closures, tail
              recursion and macros. However, xtlang also borrows heavily from
              systems languages like C and features static typing, low-level
              type expressivity, direct pointer manipulation and explicit memory
              managment (i.e. no GC). xtlang then extends these C semantics with
              type-inferencing, ad-hoc polymorphism, reified generics, and
              zone/region based memory management.

            <h3 class="text-center">Docs</h3>
            <p>
              Like any programming language, the docs are super-important for
              getting your head around things. Extempore's docs are split into three main sections:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  the overview section discusses the key concepts in
                  Extempore/xtlang programming, and is a good place to find out
                  why things are the way they are
                </li>
                <li>
                  the reference section is the main xtlang language reference
                </li>
                <li>
                  the guides section contains longer-form tutorials for new
                  users coming to Extempore from different backgrounds,
                  including musicians, programmers, and newcomers to livecoding
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              If the docs don't seem to contain the answers you're looking for,
              then the friendly Extempore community can help you out. Get in
              touch on slack or on the mailing list.
