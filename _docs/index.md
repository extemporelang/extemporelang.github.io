permalink: /docs/

Extempore's documentation is split into three main sections:

- the **overview** section discusses the key concepts in Extempore/xtlang
  programming, and is a good place to find out why things are the way they are
- the **reference** section is the main xtlang language reference
- the **guides** section contains longer-form tutorials for new users coming to
  Extempore from different backgrounds, including musicians, programmers, and
  newcomers to livecoding

To navigate, use the sidebar on the left (or on top, if you're on mobile).

## Getting help

Learning a new programming language is hard, so don't despair if you get stuck
and need help. The [mailing list](mailto:extemporelang@googlegroups.com)
(powered by [google groups](https://groups.google.com/group/extemporelang)) is a
good place to start.

This website is written in
[markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started) and designed to make
it easy to contribute. Every page has an _improve this page_ link at the bottom
which takes you directly to the source `.md` file on GitHub so that you can fix
it up and submit a pull request.

If you find any issues with these docs, let us know---contributing to the docs
[really is pretty easy]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/overview/contributing.md
%}#documentation), so don't be afraid to pipe up if you've got ideas.
