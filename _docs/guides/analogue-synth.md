title: The Extempore analogue synth
---

Before we start, make sure you've read at least the [quickstart
guide]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/overview/quickstart.md %}) and you can set
up & evaluate Extempore code on your machine.

## Introduction

The analogue synth is part of the Extempore "sharedsystem", an easy-to-set-up
signal chain with three configurable analogue synth instruments (including the
ability to load & store presets). The name is inspired by the [**Make Noise**
_Shared
System_](http://www.makenoisemusic.com/synthesizers/black-and-gold-shared-system-plus)
series of modular synths. _That_ synth is
[Eurorack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurorack)-based, so _in principle_ it
could have any/all sorts of different components, but Make Noise chose a
standard set of modules so that people can share tips/patches/ideas directly
because they're using the _same_ configurable set of modules. In the same way,
the Extempore sharedsystem is an "curated" take on Extempore's audio/music
making workflow. Obviously if it's not to your taste then you've still got the
full power of Extempore under the hood; but if you just want to fire it up and
get people dancing then the Extempore sharedsystem is a good way forward, and
it's what we'll cover in this guide üòÅ

### Loading the sharedsystem

First, let's load up the Extempore sharedsystem with:

```extempore
(sys:load "examples/sharedsystem/audiosetup.xtm")
```

Depending on your machine it might take a little while, but hang tight---you'll
get there in the end. When you see something like this then you're ready to go.

You've just loaded

- three analogue synths (`syn1`, `syn2` and `syn3`)
- a synth drum kit (`kit`)
- a sampler (`samp1`) which is initially loaded with piano samples

Don't worry about how to use them just yet, you'll see how in a minute.

<div class="note-box" markdown="1">

Loading the `examples/sharedsystem/audiosetup.xtm` library will also load up the
Extempore pattern language stuff, which is covered in more detail in [this
guide]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/guides/pattern-language.md %}). These two
things are conceptually independent---you certainly don't have to understand the
sharedsystem's analogue synths in depth if you just want to make bangin' loops
with the pattern language (or vice versa).

However, even if you're mostly interested in the sharedsystem it's still handy
to understand a bit about the pattern language for making noise with your synths
& samplers. That's the approach we'll take in this guide---we won't necessarily
explain the pattern language stuff, but you can always jump over to the [pattern
language docs]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/guides/pattern-language.md %}) to
go deeper.

</div>

The interface for configuring the synths and the samplers is a bit different, so
we'll look a them individually. Like all things in music-making, different folks
want to explore different things, so if you don't care about synths at all then
you can skip straight to the [sampler](#playing-the-sampler) part (or vice
versa).

Finally, as mentioned earlier this guide will use the [pattern
language]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _docs/guides/pattern-language.md %}) to play
some loops on your samplers & synths (so that you can actually hear them make
noise). So if you're curious about how that works then check out that guide as
well.

## Configuring & playing the synth {#playing-the-synth}

The "analogue" synth is the real workhorse of the sharedsystem audio signal
chain. It's an xtlang implementation of a flexible, modular analogue synth.

{:.note-box}

As you've probably figured out, it's not actually an _analogue_ synth, it's
purely software, and purely digital---you can see (and modify) the source code
for the whole thing in the `libs/core/instruments/analogue.xtm` file. But it's
conceptually the same as an analogue modular synth, with multiple oscillators,
filters, LFOS, etc. Furthermore, the oscillators are designed to faithfully
replicate the oscillators of an analogue synth; the saw wave has messy
"corners", there's slop in the oscillator frequency, and lots of other things
like that. So that's why it's called `analogue`.

Since you've already loaded the sharedsystem, you've already got three analogue
synth instruments (`syn1`, `syn2` and `syn3`) connected and ready to play notes
on.

Each analogue synth has:

- 4x oscillators, each of which can be one of several different types
  (`PARAM_SINE`, `PARAM_SAW`, `PARAM_PULSE`, `PARAM_TRI`, `PARAM_WHITE`,
  `PARAM_PINK`), and has individual controls for gain, tuning, etc.

- amplitude & filter envelopes (regular ADSR)

- delay/reverb/flange effects

- four LFOs (low-frequency oscillators) for parameter modulation

Some things are better explained with sample code, so the next phase of this
guide is in the example file `examples/sharedsystem/analogue_synth_basics.xtm`.
Open that file up in your text editor, play around, and see what noises you can
make üòä

## FAQ

### Why aren't there more presets?

This comes up a bit---it's discussed in the [pattern language FAQ]({% link
_docs/guides/pattern-language.md %}#changing-the-sound).

### Are there any more example files which are helpful for learning about instruments in Extempore?

Yep, you could have a look at `examples/core/synth.xtm`. In addition, all of the
covers in `examples/sharedsystem/covers/` use the synth, although in most cases
they just load a preset (as you've already seen in
`examples/sharedsystem/audio_synth_basics.xtm`). Finally, the instruments
themselves are defined in the `.xtm` files in the `libs/core/instruments/`
folder.

### It feels like the analogue synth can do lots of stuff that isn't well documented.

Well, that's not a question. But it _is_ a fair statement at the
moment---fleshing out the analogue synth docs is high on the priority list.

If you don't mind doing a bit of code spelunking, then here are the best places
to see the full range of configuration options for the analogue synth:

- the "api" is documented in `libs/core/instruments/instrument_params.xtm`

- the analogue instrument itself is in `libs/core/instruments/analogue.xtm`, and
  while it's pretty dense in the actual implementation part there's a useful
  function down the bottom of the file (`analogue_reset`) which shows more
  examples of setting the various analogue synth parameters

### You mentioned a synth drum kit earlier---where's that at?

The synth drum kit is currently under development---it currently only supports
kick, snare and HH. However, you can try it out by looking at the
`examples/sharedsystem/drum_synth_basics.xtm` example file, or even look at the
implementation of the drum synth in `libs/core/instruments/dlogue.xtm`.
