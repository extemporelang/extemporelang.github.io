title: xtlang docstrings
---

xtlang supports rich docstrings (documentation strings) with a lightweight
javadoc/jsdoc-style markup for documenting individual parameters, return values,
providing links to other, related functionality, and even examples. Here's an
example of a closure with a docstring:

```
(bind-func bens_great_function
  "a (one-line) description of the function: this is Ben's great
    function for adding two numbers together

Here's some more detail. Sometimes, you just need to add two numbers. And the +
operator just isn't up to the job. Well, that's when you need
bens_great_function (well, as long as the numbers are i64).

@param - the first number to add
@param - the second number to add
@return - the sum of the two input arguments

@example

(bens_great_function 4 7) ;; returns 11

@see bens_other_great_function - another great function to check out"
  (lambda (a:i64 b)
    (+ a b)))
```

The `@param` lines are just for providing docstrings for each argument:
the names and types of the arguments will be taken from the actual
closure body. All of the `@` tags are optional---you just write a
one-line string as the docstring.

You can also add docstrings to other (xtlang) things:

```
(bind-val bens_global_variable i32 42
   "the answer to life, the universe and everything

@see bens_other_global_variable - holds the question to which this is the answer")

(bind-lib libmissile fire_ze_missiles [void,i64]*
   "fire ze missiles!

Be careful - this function has side effects.

@param - the number of missiles to fire.
@return - check for success by looking out the window and seeing if everything is destroyed")

(bind-type BenType <i32,float>
   "this is a great type.

This type is handy for storing your favourite numbers.

@param - Ben's favourite integer
@param - Ben's favourite float

@see BenType_print")

(bind-poly print BenType_print
   "Overloaded print function for BenType

This polymorphic overload allows println to 'do the right thing' with variables
of BenType\*

@example

(let ((bt (BenType 3 5.2)))

   (println bt)) ;; prints &lt;BenType: 3 5.200&gt;

@see BenType")
```

## Contributing {#contributing}

Currently, not many xtlang functions have docstrings, and the ones that are
there aren't very detailed/informative. Over the next little while the goal is
to add/improve the docstrings in the various xtlang libraries. It's the sort of
job which can be done bit-by-bit, and it's also the sort of job which the
community can help with.

So, if you're looking for a way to contribute, and there's a particular xtlang
library which you use and feel familiar enough with to write some docstrings
for, then give it a go and send a pull request :)

This will hopefully be a virtuous cycle: as the docstrings improve then
Extempore/xtlang will become easier to
[grok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok#In_computer_programmer_culture), which
will then mean that more folks are in a position to write better docstrings and
help out. By generating the docs directly from the source code + docstrings,
hopefully the job of keeping things up to date will be a little bit easier.

So get amongst it :)
